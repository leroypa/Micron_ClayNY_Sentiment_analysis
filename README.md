# Micron_ClayNY_Sentiment_analysis
Sentiment analysis of Micron building a fab in Clay, NY.  What do the people think?

The state of New York has proposed a tax break of $5 billion to Micron to secure the biggest economic development deal in the state's history and one of the largest semiconductor projects in the United States. Micron is expected to invest $20 billion by 2030 as it builds and expands its operations in Clay, New York (Central NY).   The construction work is scheduled to commence in 2024

Micron Technology and public officials have told us for more than a year that Micron's planned semiconductor plant in Clay would create 50,000 jobs: 9,000 at the plant and 40,000 more in the community.
To understand what the people of Central New York think about this project, I ran a sentiment analysis of published articles that addressed the Micron Fab. The Google Slide presentation attempts to answer that question.
